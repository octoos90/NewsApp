# 📱 NewsApp

## Overview
The **NewsApp** is a simple iOS application built with Swift using the MVVM architecture. It displays a list of news articles on the main screen and shows detailed information when an article is tapped. The app fetches news data from a public API and presents it with a clean, user-friendly interface.

## ✨ Features
- **News List Screen**:
  - Displays a list of news articles with:
    - Title
    - Image
    - Published date
    - Short description
- **News Detail Screen**:
  - Shows detailed information about the selected news article, including the full description and image.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Swift**
- **UIKit**
- **MVVM Architecture**
- **URLSession** for API requests
- **Image Caching** for better performance

## 📋 Requirements
- iOS 14.0+
- Xcode 14+
- Swift 5.7+

## 🗂️ Project Structure
The project follows the MVVM architecture:
- **Model**: Defines the data structure for news articles.
- **View**: Handles the user interface using `UITableView` and custom cells.
- **ViewModel**: Manages data processing and state, fetching data from the API and providing it to the view.
- **Service**: Handles API calls using `URLSession`.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Ensure you have Xcode installed on your Mac (version 14 or later).
- Clone the repository:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/your-username/NewsApp.git
  cd NewsApp
  ```

### Installation
1. Open `NewsApp.xcodeproj` in Xcode.
2. Build and run the project using the Xcode simulator or a connected iOS device.

## 🌐 API Integration
The app fetches data from a public news API. The API provides news articles, including the title, description, image URL, and published date. No authorization is required.

## 🧩 Architecture
The app uses **MVVM** (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture:
- **Model**: Represents the data structure (e.g., `NewsArticle` struct).
- **View**: Includes the view controllers and custom table view cells.
- **ViewModel**: Contains the business logic, data processing, and handles the interaction between the view and the model.
- **Service**: Handles API requests and data fetching.

## 🛑 Error Handling
The app includes basic error handling, such as:
- Displaying alerts for network errors.
- Placeholder images for missing or failed image loads.
- Handling empty states when no data is available.

## 📈 Improvements
- Add pull-to-refresh functionality.
- Implement pagination for large data sets.
- Enhance UI with more animations or transitions.
